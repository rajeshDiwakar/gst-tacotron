Made a wrong turn

Once or twice

Dug my way out

Blood and fire

Bad decisions

That's alright

Welcome to my silly life



Mistreated

Misplaced

Misunderstood

Miss no way it's all good

It didn't slow me down.



Mistaken

Always second guessing

Underestimated

Look I'm still around



Pretty, pretty please

Don't you ever, ever feel

Like you're less than

Less than perfect



Pretty, pretty please

If you ever, ever feel

Like you're nothing

You are perfect

To me



You're so mean

When you talk

About yourself, you were wrong

Change the voices in your head

Make them like you instead



So complicated

Look how we all make it

Filled with so much hatred

Such a tired game



It's enough

I've done all I can think of

Chased down all my demons

I'll see you do the same



Pretty, pretty please

Don't you ever, ever feel

Like you're less than

Less than perfect



Pretty, pretty please

If you ever, ever feel

Like you're nothing

You are perfect

To me



Whole world scared so I swallowed the fear

The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer

So cool in lying and we try, try, try but we try too hard

And it's a waste of my time.

Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere

They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair

Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time

Why do we do that, why do I do that, why do I do that?

Yeah, oh

Oh pretty pretty please



Pretty, pretty please

Don't you ever, ever feel

Like you're less than

Less than perfect



Pretty, pretty please

If you ever, ever feel

Like you're nothing

You are perfect

To me



You're perfect

You're perfect

(To me)



Pretty, pretty please

If you ever, ever feel

Like you're nothing

You are perfect

To me
