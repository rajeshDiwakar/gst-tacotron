If I could catch a star for you I swear I'd steal them all tonight

To make your every wish come true and every dream for all your life



But that's not how the story goes

The world is full of perfect plans

If there's a promise that I broke, I know one day you will understand



When times are hard I know you'll be strong

I'll be there in your heart and you'll carry on

Like moonlight on the water, and sunlight in the sky

Fathers and daughters never say goodbye



An Angel I will read to sleep, gave me one dream of my own

So learn to love and spread your wings, and find the one to call your home



When times are hard I know you'll be strong

I'll be there in your heart and you'll carry on

Like moonlight on the water, and sunlight in the sky

Fathers and daughters never say goodbye



When times are hard I know you'll be strong

I'll be there in your heart and you'll carry on

Like moonlight on the water, and sunlight in the sky



Fathers and daughters never say goodbye

Fathers and daughters never say goodbye
