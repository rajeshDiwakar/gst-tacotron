If I should die before I wake
Because you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world without no air, oh
I`m here alone, didn`t wanna leave
My heart won`t move, it`s incomplete
Is there an other way I can make you understand?
(Hook)
But how
Do you expect me, to live alone with just me?
`Cause my world revolves around you
It`s so hard for me to breathe
(Chorus)
Tell me how I`m supposed to breathe with no air?
Can`t live, can`t breath with no air
That`s how I feel whenever ain`t there
There`s no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon` be here without me?
If you ain`t here I just can`t breathe
There`s no air, no air
No air air, No air air
I walked, I ran, I jumped,
I took right off the ground to float to you
There`s no gravity to hold me down, for real
But somehow I`m still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I don`t know how but I don`t even care
(Hook)
So how do you expect me to live alone with just me?
`Cause my world revolves around you
It`s so hard for me to breathe
(Chorus)
Tell me how I`m supposed to breathe with no air?
Can`t live, can`t breath with no air
That`s how I feel whenever ain`t there
There`s no air, no air
Got me here out in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon` be here without me?
If you ain`t here I just can`t breathe
There`s no air, no air
No air air, No air air
(Chorus)
Tell me how I`m supposed to breathe with no air?
Can`t live, can`t breath with no air
That`s how I feel whenever ain`t there
There`s no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon` be here without me?
If you ain`t here I just can`t breathe
There`s no air, no air
No air air, No air air
(Outro)
Got me here out in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon` be here without me?
If you ain`t here I just can`t breathe
There`s no air, no air
No air air, No air air
