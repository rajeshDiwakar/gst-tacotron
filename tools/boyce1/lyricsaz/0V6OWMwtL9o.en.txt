She calls me from the cold

Just when I was low, feeling short of stable

All that she intends

And all she keeps inside isn't on the label



She says she's ashamed

And can she take me for awhile?

And can I be a friend

We'll forget the past but maybe I'm not able

And I break at the bend



We're here and now

Will we ever be again

'Cause I have found

All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again



She dreams a champagne dream

Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper

Lavender and cream

Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her



She says that love is for fools who fall behind

And I'm somewhere between

I never really know a killer from a savior

'Til I break at the bend



We're here and now

Will we ever be again

'Cause I have found

All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again



It's too far away for me to hold too far away

It's too far away for me to hold too far away



It's too far away for me to hold too far away

It's too far away for me to hold too far away

It's too far away for me to hold too far away

It's too far away for me to hold too far away



Guess I'll let it go
