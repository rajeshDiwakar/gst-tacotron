See the stone set in your eyes

See the thorn twist in your side

I wait for you



Sleight of hand and twist of fate

On a bed of nails she makes me wait

And I wait for you



And I can't live

With or without you

With or without you

With or without you



Through the storm we reach the shore

Give it all but I want more

And I'm waiting for you



With or without you

With or without you

I can't live

Oh, with or without you

With or without you



And you give yourself away

And you give yourself away

And you give

And you give

And you give yourself away



My hands are tied

My body bruised

I've got nothing to win and

Nothing left to lose



And you give yourself away

And you give yourself away

And you give

And you give

And you give



I can't live

With or without you

With or without you

Oh, with or without you
