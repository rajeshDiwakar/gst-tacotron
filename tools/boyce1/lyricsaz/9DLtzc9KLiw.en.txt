[Verse 1:]

Born sinner, half nigga with a ER

Traveling local, no agent or PR

This big room in a house with no one to share it with

If she was alive, I swear to God, I'd move my grandma in

Lost focus, trying to mend this broken heart

Writing words on my phone and hopes it will show my art

The older that we get, the more we grow apart

It was built on a lie, we came from a hopeless start

And I'm not supposed to rap about my feelings, never

Supposed to make a lot of jokes and say some shit that's clever

And act like I'm balling and fucking bitches

Man, fake it till you make it's gotta be the worst expression ever

I'd rather only portray the things that are real

Even if that shit does cost me a record deal

And you could say that I'm stupid or say I'm foolish

But I'm living off this music, I'll never know how your desk will feel




[Hook:]

And I'm just fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)

I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)

I thank the fans for telling me I'm the man

I'm just glad I can finally give you something to believe in

And I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)

I'm fighting off my demons (Fighting off my demons)

I wanna thank the fans for accepting who I am

Understand you're the reason why I'm breathing




[Verse 2:]

I put that gun to my head and then I put it down

I threw it in the river, let the bullets drown

I'm known as this funny I'll go and rapper guy

But really, you don't know what goes on when you're not around

And then I thought about it, a selfish sacrifice

The afterlife, if heaven's real then would I go there?

And then I thought about the shit me and my friends did

If I do make it, there'll be nobody I know there

And I'm fighting off these tears, but I'm failing

Every time I feel like I'm better, I fucking relapse

I'm spitting image of my dad, I used to think that was a bad thing

But now I'm not even ashamed to be that

A good man who made mistakes just like the rest of us

Life is short, look at the time that he invest in us

We've had our differences, people change with the seasons

We fighting off all our demons and let you pick up what's left of us




[Hook]
