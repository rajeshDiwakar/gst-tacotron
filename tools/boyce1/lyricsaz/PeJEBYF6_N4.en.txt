I got a pocket,

Got a pocketful of sunshine

I've got a love and I know that it's all mine

Oh, oh, oh

Do what you want,

But you're never gonna break me,

Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me

Oh, oh, oh



Take me away (take me away)

A secret place (a secret place)

A sweet escape (a sweet escape)

Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away

To better days (to better days)

Take me away (take me away)

A hiding place (a hiding place)



I got a pocket,

Got a pocketful of sunshine

I've got a love and I know that it's all mine

Oh, oh, oh

Do what you want,

But you're never gonna break me,

Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me

Oh, oh, oh



I got pocket,

Got a pocketful of sunshine

I've got a love and I know that it's all mine

Oh, oh, oh



Wish that you could,

But you ain't gonna own me

Do anything you can to control me

Oh, oh, oh



Take me away (take me away)

A secret place (a secret place)

A sweet escape (a sweet escape)

Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away

To better days (to better days)

Take me away (take me away)

A hiding place (a hiding place)



There's a place that I go

That nobody knows

Where the rivers flow

And I call it home

And there's no more lies

And the darkness is light

And nobody cries

There's only butterflies



Take me away (take me away)

A secret place (a secret place)

A sweet escape (a sweet escape)

Take me away (take me away)

Take me away (take me away

To better days (to better days)

Take me away (take me away)

A hiding place (a hiding place)


[3x]



I got a pocket,

Got a pocketful of sunshine

I've got a love and I know that it's all mine

Oh, oh, oh


[2x]



The sun is on my side

Take me for a ride

I smile up to the sky

I know I'll be alright


[2x]
