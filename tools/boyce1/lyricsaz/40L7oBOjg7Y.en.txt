Every breath you take

And every move you make

Every bond you break,

Every step you take

Iâll be watching you



Every single day

And every word you say

Every game you play,

Every night you stay

Iâll be watching you



Oh, canât you see

You belong to me? 

My poor heart aches

With every step you take



Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake,

Every claim you stake

Iâll be watching you



Since youâve gone Iâve been lost without a trace

I dream at night, I can only see your face

I look around, but itâs you I canât replace

I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby please



Oh, canât you see

You belong to me? 

How my poor heart aches

With every step you take



Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake,

Every claim you stake

Iâll be watching you

Every move you make,

Every step you take

Iâll be watching you

Every move you make,

Every step you take

Iâll be watching you



Every breath you take

Every move you make

Every bone you break

Every step you take

Every single day

Every word you say

Every game you play

Every night you stay

Every move you make

Every heart you break

Every smile you fake

Every thing you stake

Every breath you take

Every move you make

Every bond you break

Every step you take
