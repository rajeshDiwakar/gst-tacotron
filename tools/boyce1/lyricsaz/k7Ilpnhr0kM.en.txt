Hold me

Like the river Jordan

And I will then say to thee

You are my friend



Carry me

Like you are my brother

Love me like a mother

Will you be there?



Weary

Tell me will you hold me?

When wrong, will you scold me?

When lost will you find me?



But they told me

A man should be faithful

And walk when not able

And fight 'til the end

But I'm only human



Everyone's taking control of me

Seems that the world's got a role for me

I'm so confused will you show to me

You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me



(hold me)

Show me

(lay your head lowly)

Told me

(softly then boldly)

Yeah

(carry me there)

I'm only human



(lead me)

Hold me

(love me and feed me)

Yeah, yeah

(kiss me and free me)

Yeah

(I will feel blessed)

I'm only human



(carry)

Carry

(carry me boldly)

Carry, yeah

(lift me up slowly)

Yeah

(carry me there)

I'm only human



(save me)

Lead me

(heal me and bathe me)

Lift me up, lift me up

(softly you say to me)

(I will be there)

I will be there



(lift me)

Told me, yeah

(lift me up slowly)

(carry me boldly)

Yeah

(show me you care)

Show me you care



(hold me)

Woo

(lay your head lowly)

Get lonely sometimes

(softly then boldly)

I get lonely, yeah, yeah

(carry me there)

Will you be there



(lead me)

Woo

(love me and feed me)

Lift me up, hold me up

(kiss me and free me)

Lift me up sometimes, oh, sometimes

(I will feel blessed)

Yeah



In our darkest hour

In my deepest despair

Will you still care?

Will you be there?



In my trials

And my tribulations

Through our doubts

And frustrations



In my violence

In my turbulence

Through my fear

And my confessions



In my anguish and my pain

Through my joy and my sorrow

In the promise of another tomorrow

I'll never let you part

For you're always in my heart
