We don't even talk anymore

We don't even know what we argue about

Don't even say I love you no more

Cause sayin' how we feel is no longer allowed

Some people work things out

And some just don't know how to change




[Chorus:]

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

We might watch our whole lives pass us by

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

Don't do it baby



Now they can see the tears in our eyes

But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts

Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide

Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart

Why do we hurt each other

Why do we push love away




[Chorus:]

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry (No no baby)

We might watch our whole lives pass us by (We might watch our whole lives)

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives

Don't do it baby



No, oooooooooh, oh, oh, oh, oh

No, oooooooooh, oh, oh, oh, oh



Some people will work things out

And some just don't know how to change



Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

We might watch our whole lives pass us by

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

We'll make the biggest mistakes of our lives

Don't do it baby



No, oooooooooh, oh, oh

No, oooooooooh, oh, oh



Don't do it baby

No, oooooooooh, oh, oh, oh, oh

No, oooooooooh, oh, oh, oh, oh



Don't do it baby
