I hear the clock, it's six A.M

I feel so far from where I've been

I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too

I got my maple syrup, everything but you



I break the yolks and make a smiley face

I kinda like it in my brand new place

Wipe the spots off of the mirror

Don't leave my keys in the door

I never put wet towels on the floor anymore

'Cause



Dreams last so long

Even after you're gone

I know that you love me

And soon you will see

You were meant for me

And I was meant for you



I called my mamma, she was out for a walk

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk

So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news

More hearts bein' broken, more people being used



Put on my coat in the pouring rain

I saw a movie it just wasn't the same

'Cause it was happy or I was sad

And it made me miss you oh so bad

'Cause



Dreams last so long

Even after you're gone

I know that you love me

And soon you will see

You were meant for me

And I was meant for you



I go about my business, I'm doing fine

Besides what would I say if I had you on the line?

Same old story, not much to say

Hearts are broken, every day



I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on

I know you hate it when I leave the light on

I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down

And then I take a deep breath and a good look around



Put on my pj's and hop into bed

I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead

I try and tell myself it'll all be alright

I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

'Cause



Dreams last so long

Even after you're gone

I know that you love me

And soon you will see

You were meant for me

And I was meant for you



Yeah, you were meant for me and I was meant for you
