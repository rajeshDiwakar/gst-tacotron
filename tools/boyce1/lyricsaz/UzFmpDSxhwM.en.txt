Well I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me

This all or nothing's really got a way of driving me crazy



I need somebody to heal

Somebody to know

Somebody to have

Somebody to hold

It's easy to say

But it's never the same

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain



Now the day bleeds

Into nightfall

And you're not here

To get me through it all

I let my guard down

Then you pulled the rug

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved



I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to

This all or nothing way of loving's got me sleeping without you



Now, I need somebody to know

Somebody to heal

Somebody to have

Just to know how it feels

It's easy to say

But it's never the same

I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape



Now the day bleeds

Into nightfall

And you're not here

To get me through it all

I let my guard down

Then you pulled the rug

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved



And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes

And I fall into your arms

I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around



Now the day bleeds

Into nightfall

And you're not here

To get me through it all

I let my guard down

Then you pulled the rug

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
