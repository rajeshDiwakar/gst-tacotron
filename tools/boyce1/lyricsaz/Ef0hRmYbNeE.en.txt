Saw the world turning in my sheets

And once again I cannot sleep.

Walk out the door and up the street;

Look at the stars beneath my feet.

Remember rights that I did wrong, so here I go.



Hello, hello. There is no place I cannot go.

My mind is muddy but my heart is heavy. Does it show?

I lose the track that loses me, so here I go.



And so I sent some men to fight,

And one came back at dead of night.

Said he'd seen my enemy.

Said he looked just like me,

So I set out to cut myself and here I go.



I'm not calling for a second chance,

I'm screaming at the top of my voice.

Give me reason but don't give me choice.

'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again.



And maybe someday we will meet,

And maybe talk and not just speak.

Don't buy the promises

'Cause there are no promises I keep.

And my reflection troubles me, so here I go.



I'm not calling for a second chance,

I'm screaming at the top of my voice.

Give me reason but don't give me choice.

'Cause I'll just make the same mistake,



I'm not calling for a second chance,

I'm screaming at the top of my voice.

Give me reason but don't give me choice.

'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again.



Saw the world turning in my sheets

And once again I cannot sleep.

Walk out the door and up the street;

Look at the stars.

Look at the stars fall down.

And wonder where did I go wrong.
