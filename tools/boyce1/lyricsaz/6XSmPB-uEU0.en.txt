You've got your ball

You've got your chain

Tied to me tight tie me up again

Who's got their claws

In you my friend

Into your heart I'll beat again



Sweet like candy to my soul

Sweet you rock

And sweet you roll

Lost for you

I'm so lost for you 



Oh, when you come crash into me

And I come into you

And I come into you

In a boy's dream

In a boy's dream



Touch your lips just so I know

In your eyes, love, it glows so

I'm bare-boned and crazy for you



Oh, when you come crash into me, baby

And I come into you

In a boy's dream

In a boy's dream



If I've gone overboard

Then I'm begging you to forgive me

Oh, in my haste

When I'm holding you so, girl

Close to me



Oh, and you come crash into me, baby

And I come into you



Oh, hike up your skirt a little more

You show the world to me

Hike up your skirt a little more

You show your world to me

In a boy's dream

In a boy's dream



Oh, I watch you there

Through the window and I stare

At you wear nothing 

But you wear it so well

Tied up and twisted

The way I'd like to be

For you, for me

Come crash into me, baby

Come crash into me, yeah



Crash into me

Crash into me

Crash into me

Crash into me



Oh, you know

I'm the king of the castle

You're the dirty rascal

Crash into me

Please, crash into me



I see the wave coming crash into me

See the wave coming crash into me

Crash into me
