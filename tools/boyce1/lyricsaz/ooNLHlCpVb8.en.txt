I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean

I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand

But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did

'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind

I always thought I would sink, so I never swam

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'

And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand



But here I am, next to you (hey, hey)

The sky's more blue in Malibu (hey, hey)

Next to you in Malibu (hey, hey)

Next to you




[Miley Cyrus & Dillon Francis:]

In Malibu

In Malibu



We watched the sun go down as we were walking

I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking

You would explain the current, as I just smile

Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change

And it'll be us, just for a while

Do we even exist?

That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish

Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?

I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me

I'd be here writing this song (hey)



But here I am, next to you (hey, hey)

The sky's so blue in Malibu (hey, hey)

Next to you in Malibu (hey, hey)

Next to you
